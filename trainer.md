### Basic functions
- Training loop
- Evaluation loop
- checkpointing
- logging training and evaluation metrics
- Customized optimizer
- Customized learning rate schedular
### Advanced
- Multi-GPU support
- Gradient accumulation

## Usage Example ðŸ’¡
The repository provides a **base trainer class** (`BaseTrainer`) available via:

    from ml_utils import BaseTrainer

You can extend this class to implement customized training workflows.  
Examples of such customizations are provided in [ml_utils/trainers/trainer.py](./ml_utils/trainers/trainers.py).
